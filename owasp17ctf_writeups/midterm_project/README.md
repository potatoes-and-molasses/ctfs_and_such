# Midterm Project
 **Categories:** web
 
 **Description:** 
 
> An informant told me that our old friend dustin backups all of his data into a private Xenon server in a pretty new and small Firm that does web hosting, you can find their website here -
> https://superwebhosting.xyz
> Reach out to them and help me find his website so I can steal his semester project and hand it to my professor before him.

> Hint:my informant just sent me this message:
> All "Xenon File Repositories" don't have access to the internet.
> do you think you can still find a loophole in thier system?

## Story-time!
